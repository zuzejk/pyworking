2. Why to use IDE


PYCHARM

1. About
    - 3 versions: EDU Edition (for free, contains some simple python tutorials, it has the least functions),
                  Community Edition (for free, it has enough function for most developers),
                  Professional edition (paid, server integration...)
    - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PyCharm

2. Installation - You can download PyCharm directly from their site but it is better to go through Jetbrain Toolbox (https://www.jetbrains.com/toolbox/app/) as it offers
                  more options from all jetbrains apps, you get updates automatically, also you can use several versions of the product which you have in one place
                  same as all your projects, https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/jetbrains-toolbox-extensi/offnedcbhjldheanlbojaefbfbllddna google chrome extension for Github
    1. macOS

        - Go to https://www.jetbrains.com/toolbox/app/ , click on download .DMG file, then click on the downloaded file and drag the Toolbox icon to Applications, find Jetbrains
          Toolbox in Applications. When you open it, you can skip the registration and then see many different apps. We will go with PyCharm Community Edition, click install and then open.
          It will ask you if you want to import settings from previous versions but as this is yours first Jetbrains app, make sure "Do not import settings" is checked. A small window
          with IDE color settings will pop up. This is totally up to you, you can also skip it and set it later.
