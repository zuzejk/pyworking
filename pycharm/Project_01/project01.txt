Settings & New Project

1. Settings
Great, installation is done and now we have to go through some basic settings. In PyCharm you have 2 kinds of settings -
global settings (all projects) and project settings (apply only for the specific project). "Configure" on this welcome
page are global settings. Choose "Preferences" and type "project interpreter" in the search box. On the right side click
on the drop down menu and choose your default interpreter for all your projects from now on (for all your existing
projects you have to set the interpreter manually in project settings). Click on "Apply" and then "OK".
NOTE: If you update version of Python, don't forget to update also the settings in PyCharm.

2. New project
- You are back on the welcome page. Click on "Create New Project", choose "Location" where you want your projects will
  be saved (PyCharm automatically created a directory "PyCharms Projects" but you can choose your own destination and
  delete this directory). As you can see "Interpreter" is set already as the one we set before in global settings.
  Nothing much to do here, so click "Create".
- For each project we need virtualenv. Go to "File" in top menu, "Default Settings", type "project interpreter" and on
  the right side, next to the box with your interpreter is sprocket (settings icon), choose "Create VirtualEnv" and then
  write "Name" and "Location" (has to be same directory as your project), click "OK". Now you see that only pip and
  setuptools are installed. To install more modules use terminal and "pip install ..." or you can click the plus icon
  on the bottom, choose package for installation, click "Install" and close window. When you are done, click "Apply" and
  "OK", it will return you back to your project.
- Now we need to create a python file to write some code in. In the bar menu choose "File" > "New" > "Python File"
  and fill the "Name" (without .py) in, click "OK".
- Type some code in file.
- On the bottom of the IDE click on "Terminal" and run your code.
- On the left side you see tab "Project" in which you are right now and you see everything what your project contains.
  First is project it self and all its files, then you can click on "External Libraries" and see what interpreter is
  default and what packages are installed.
